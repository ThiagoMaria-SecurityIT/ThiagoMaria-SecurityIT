## Hi, I'm Thiago Maria üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am a Security Information Professional from Brazil with strong development skills, focusing on the practical application of technology in **Cybersecurity**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Automation**.    

My work is centered on building open-source tools and resources that address real-world challenges and improve security processes through awareness and collaboration.

This GitHub profile was started in May 2025, inspired by a DIO course about Azure and Python I did in the same year. This course was the trigger for creating and sharing my projects with the community.
